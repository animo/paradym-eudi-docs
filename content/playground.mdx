# The Playground

The [Animo playground](https://playground.animo.id/) enables you to test several issuance flows and verification flows. You can configure different options and see detailed developer-focused output.

This playground implements OpenID4VC 1.0, OpenID4VP 1.0, SD-JWT VC, mDOC, and most of the High Assurance Interop Profile (full support pending).

You can use it with the [Paradym Wallet](https://linktr.ee/paradym_id), or any other wallet implementation compliant with the High Assurance Interoperability Profile. If you experience any issues when using this playground, please open an issue in the [Playground GitHub](https://github.com/animo/openid4vc-playground).
