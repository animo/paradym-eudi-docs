<Callout type="info">The Potential Large Scale Pilot ended in 2025.</Callout>


The [Potential](https://www.digital-identity-wallet.eu/) consortium was one of the Large Scale Pilot consortia selected by the European Commission. Potential ran from 2023 - 2025 and featured 19 European member states and Ukraine, as well as 140+ public and private partners, who committed to work together to test six common EU use cases with the digital identity wallet. 

The Paradym Wallet was used for testing in 5/6 use cases through it's involvement in the [SPRIN-D EUDI Wallet Prototype](https://www.sprind.org/en/actions/challenges/eudi-wallet-prototypes) Funke competition, namely:

- Bank Account Opening
- SIM Card Registration
- Mobile Driving License
- Qualified eSignature 
- ePrescription

Resources resulting from testing with Potential have resulted in iterations of the current Paradym wallet, and featured in several [demonstrations and video](demos-and-video.mdx).
