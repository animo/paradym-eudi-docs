# Findynet

The Paradym wallet is participating in the [Findynet Cooperative](https://findynet.fi/) effort to fund and test digital identity wallets with the Finnish market. Within the projects, participating wallets committed to support the technical requirements of the Findy network and translate their wallets into Finnish and Swedish.
